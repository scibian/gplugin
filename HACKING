GPlugin uses hgflow[1] for development.  All development takes place on the
develop branch which leaves default to be a stable release clone.  All long
term feature/bug fix work should take place on a feature branch that when
closed, gets merged to develop.

Releases are forked from develop and create a new branch for any testing/bug
fixes.  When a release is deemed done, it's merged back into develop and into
default.  hgflow takes care of all of this for us.

To add a feature please fork https://bitbucket.org/gplugin/main.  Then clone
your fork.  Once you have your fork cloned and hgflow setup and installed, type

  hg flow feature start $NAME_OF_YOUR_FEATURE$

This will create a new branch for you to do your work on.  When you submit a
pull request, make sure it's this branch that you're requesting I pull.
