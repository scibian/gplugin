Dependencies
============
GPlugin depends on the following at a bare minimum:
	glib-2.0 >= 2.20.0
	gobject-introspection, libgirepository1.0-dev
	cmake >= 2.8
	gettext
	help2man
	a C compiler

A full build (enabled by default) depends on the following:
	gtk-3
	python3-dev, python-gi-dev, python3-gi
	liblua5.1-0-dev, lua-lgi
	xsltproc

All of these packages and their development headers need to be installed
prior to building GPlugin.

Building
========
GPlugin uses CMake (http://www.cmake.org) as its build system.  As such
compiling is a little bit different than your typical ./configure, make,
sudo make install.  But luckily for you, not too much different.

While it is not required, it is highly recommended that you use a separate
build dir.  As such, these instructions use a separate build directory.

To compile you need to run the following commands:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	sudo make install

If you want/need to tweak the build system (to enable/disable certain loaders)
you can do so at any time by using a CMake user interface.  For example, if you
have the CMake curses gui installed, you can do this by running "ccmake .."
from the build directory.
